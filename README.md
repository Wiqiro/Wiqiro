### ðŸ–¥ Here are some of my personal projects:

|Project|Description|Status|
|---|---|:---:|
| [**TicTacToe**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/TicTacToe-SDL) | Implementation of the TicTacToe game in C, using SDL for the graphics. I also implemented the minimax algotithm, so it is impossible to win !|âœ”|
| [**Pentris**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/Pentris) | My original idea was to make a Tetris inspired "game" with polynomios falling from both sides, to experiment with the SDL library in C. I quickly stopped working on it, as I wanted to try other ideas. |âœ–|
| [**Polyhexes**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/polyhexes) | This project is similar to [**Pentris**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/Pentris), but with hexagons instead of squares. The main goal was to make clean hexagons using OpenGL. |âœ–|
| [**Snake**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/SDL-snake) | Speed-coded snake game in C++ and SDL (joke) |âœ”|
| [**Checkers**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/Checkers) | Checkers game as my first C project |âœ”|
