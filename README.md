<h3 align="center">Welcome to my Github profile !</h3>
<br>
My name is William and I'm studying computer engineering at UTBM in France.

## Here are some of the projects I've been working on 

### [üçâ PL$tek project](https://github.com/PLStek)

PL$tek is a discord-based group created to help common core student at UTBM.
As a member of the project, I was in charge of developping a new website to **centralize learning resources.**
The app was initially built with Angular and FastAPI, and later redesigned to meet new requirements, this time as a single **full-stack Next.js project**.

### [ü§ñ Simplified AI model trainer](https://github.com/DE50-AI-Training)

This project was developed during my final semester at UTBM. It is a web app designed to **let non-developers easily create and train simple AI models**.
Users can import their own datasets, configure a Multi-Layer Perceptron model for classification or regression tasks, and then use the model to make predictions on new inputs.

The project was carried out in an agile team of five students, where I served as **Scrum Master** and **developer**. As a developer, I worked on the API connecting to the training service, as well as the frontend.

### üßëüèª My other personal projects

|Project|Description|Status|
|---|---|:---:|
| [**HyTracker**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/HyTracker) | A Hypixel stats tracking app written in flutter |‚ãØ|
| [**TicTacToe**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/TicTacToe-SDL) | Implementation of the TicTacToe game in C, using SDL for the graphics. I also implemented the minimax algotithm, so it is impossible to win !|‚úî|
| [**Pentris**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/Pentris) | My original idea was to make a Tetris inspired "game" with polynomios falling from both sides, to experiment with the SDL library in C. I quickly stopped working on it, as I wanted to try other ideas. |‚úñ|
| [**Polyhexes**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/polyhexes) | This project is similar to [**Pentris**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/Pentris), but with hexagons instead of squares. The main goal was to make clean hexagons using OpenGL. |‚úñ|
| [**Snake**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/SDL-snake) | Speed-coded snake game in C++ and SDL (joke) |‚úî|
| [**Checkers**](https://github.com/Wiqiro/Checkers) | Checkers game as my first C project |‚úî|
